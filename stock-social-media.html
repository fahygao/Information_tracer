            <h3>A bit of Background of Social Media and Myself</h3>
            <p>Social media has transcended its initial purpose as a platform for sharing personal experiences and connecting with friends. Over the past decade, it has emerged as a formidable force in the world of financial markets, profoundly shaping investment decisions and market behavior. 
            </p>
            <p>
             Had been working at an event-driven hedge fund, my firsthand experience working at an event-driven Hedge Fund has allowed me to witness this transformation up close. Portfolio managers, like those I worked with, closely monitor platforms such as Twitter, where tweets become the pulse of market sentiment. In this age of digital connection, understanding the collective voice of the online community is vital for investors seeking to decipher the market's moods and make informed trading decisions.
            </p>
            <p>As we navigate through this blog, we will uncover the correlation between social media posts and changes in stock prices, particularly in the context of a specific case involving the advertisement controversy of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev). This intriguing case study will serve as a lens through which we explore the intricate dynamics of this correlation.

              AB InBev is the world’s largest and multinational beverage and brewing company based in Belgium. It has a diverse portfolio of brands, such as Budweiser, Harbin, and Corona. Among all the popular products, the company's influence extends far beyond its flagship brand, Bud Light, as it is the top-selling beer for over two decades, holding a significant share of the global beer market. 
            </p>
            <p>However, since April 2023 due to the controversial partnership with transgender social media influencer and TV personality Dylan Mulvaney across major social media, Bud Light lost its top title and resulted in an unprecedented  <strong>34% plunge in sales</strong>  over three months, ultimately triggering a substantial <strong> 20% drop in the stock prices of AB InBev</strong>, especially in its American Depository Receipt (ARD) $BUD. This drastic shift was instigated by a groundswell of negative sentiment expressed across major social media, ultimately igniting a firestorm of controversy involving prominent right-wing and conservative figures and beer enthusiasts.

            <h3>Stage 0: The bigger picture</h3>
            <p>
              First of all, let us take a glance at the general picture. Here is a stock movement of $BUD from the beginning of this year to now using the close price. 
            </p>
            <a href="#!"
              ><img
                class="img-fluid"
                src="assets/img/2.png"
                alt="$BUD"
            /></a>
            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >Stock movement of $BUD Year to Date</span>
            <p>
             Noticeably, despite the peak at the end of March because of good annual results in 2022, the stock price has dropped over <strong>10% since the beginning of 2023 </strong>. From March 31st, 2023 to May 31st, 2023, the share price suffered a <strong>20% loss in 2 months</strong>. 

            </p>
      
            <p>
             What can be the cause of this loss? Earnings reports, economic conditions, market sentiment and industry trends are all major factors to affect the stock price. 
           </p>
           <p> First of all, AB InBev has its quarterly earnings report in March and June, so we can directly exclude the impact from these reports. Secondly, it is true that the U.S. is suffering from inflation, and it could be the reason due to the reduced consumer spending and rising interest rate. After comparing the change of $BUD price and the performance of the underlying market, even though there are similar patterns based on the average beta 0.84 of $BUD, it seems that the market is not responsible for the drop in $BUD, especially in May.
            </p><img
                class="img-fluid"
                src="assets/img/3.png"
                alt="$BUD and $SPY"
            />
            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >Stock Price of $BUD and S&P 500 ETF YTD</span>
            <p>
              Then, to show the industry trends, here is the comparison between the prices of AB InBev and other major beer brands such as Molson Coors ($TAP) and Constellation Brands ($STZ). We can see that as soon as the price of $BUD dropped, $TAP price roared. And in general, Beer consumption remains stable during the times of recession, and major beer brands have risen during the 2 months period.
            </p>
            <img
                class="img-fluid"
                src="assets/img/5.png"
                alt="$BUD and its competitors"
            />
            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >Stock movement of $BUD and its competitors YTD</span>
            <p>
              We observed that the overall beer industry in general performed well. And the top competitor $TAP increased dramatically when the $BUD started to lose its value. What could be the reasons left to cause this change? It is not hard to think if the controversy started in April would be the reason. Let us start to dive into the controversy. 
            </p>
            <p>
Based on the stock movement of $BUD, we can divide the changes into three major drops: the drop appeared between April 3rd and April 12th, the drop appeared between April 27th and May 3rd, and the drop between May 4th and May 31st.
            </p>

                alt="three drops"
            />
            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >Three major drops</span>
            <h3>Stage 1: Analysis of major drops</h3>
            <br />
            <h5>First drop (April 3rd to April 12th)</h5>
            <p>
              On April 1st, the Saturday, Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender actress and a TikTok personality with 10.5 million followers posted a sponsored video in which she appears in an Audrey Hepburn getup and goofs on March Madness. Dylan also showed one can that featured a custom design of her face from Bud Light, to celebrate her one year of transitioning. This was part of a larger campaign to address Bud Light's decline in sales and attract younger audiences with diversity.

            <p>
              However, this video quickly triggered enormous negativity from American conservatives. On the next Monday, April 3rd, country singer Kid Rock's viral video, in which he fired shots at Bud Light cases with an MP5 submachine gun while donning a MAGA hat, became a rallying cry for the opposition, with the video garnering over <strong>2 million views</strong>.

            <p>
              Starting from Kid Rock’s video on Twitter, the controversial Bud Light and Dylan Mulvaney partnership swiftly sparked a significant backlash from American conservatives and anti-trans groups. Within one day, calls for a boycott of Bud Light and its parent company, Anheuser-Busch, reverberated across social media platforms, and right-wing media figures, including those at Fox News, launched disparaging and transphobic criticisms against Mulvaney.

             In the following two weeks, this call for a boycott gained momentum, with many consumers refusing to purchase Bud Light or any Anheuser-Busch products at bars or stores. Country artist Travis Tritt joined Kid Rock in supporting the boycott, while singer Ted Nugent vehemently criticized Anheuser-Busch's partnership with Mulvaney, pledging to keep their products out of his world. John Rich, a country music singer-songwriter, also announced that he would no longer sell Anheuser-Busch products at his Nashville bar.

             Not longer afterwards, the sales of Bud Light took a direct hit. By the week ending April 8, 2023, Bud Light's sales had already plummeted by <strong>11% nationally</strong>, a distressing indicator of the impact of the boycott.The following week, ending April 15, witnessed an even more drastic downturn, with sales <strong>dropping by a staggering 21%</strong>; $BUD stock price <strong>dropped by 3%</strong>.

             As a response, on April 14th Anheuser-Busch's US CEO Brendan Whitworth released a statement that indirectly referred to the Mulvaney-Bud Light partnership.The statement said, "We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer."

              Even though the stock price and sales went up in the following week, the general feedback across major social media is negative; specifically, the most common sentiment is anger after gathering all the feeds that contain the keywords “Brandan Whitworth” and “Anheuser-Busch”, which potentially lead to the second drop on $BUD.

              The boycott started to add criticism and pressure on the Vice president of Marketing for Bud Light, Alissa Heinerscheid, who was in charge of the marketing decision and promoted inclusivity. Especially on Twitter and Facebook, Alissa was largely targeted for harassment on the decline in sales and brand reputation. People were mainly sharing the rumors that she has identified as unemployed and mocking her statement earlier on Bud Light a “fratty, out-of-touch” brand.

             On April 27th, Mulvaney addressed the uproar over her Bud Light partnership for the first time in a front-facing social media video. After what must have been a truly surreal month of watching transphobes shoot cans of Bud Light over a simple ad, Mulvaney said that she felt “very dissociative” during the preceding weeks.

            >
            <p>However, AB InBev still has not directly addressed the reduction in sales yet but confirmed in a statement that Alissa Heinerscheid and Daniel Blake, who oversees marketing for Anheuser-Busch’s mainstream brands, were on a leave of absence. This news inevitably became a compromise to the boycott. More trendy videos on TikTok and Twitter showed people smashing, throwing away, and even running over Bud Light bottles. The situation took a darker turn with threats directed at Anheuser-Busch factories, including bomb threats that forced some facilities to close. </p>
            <p>
              Adding the executive shakeup to the continuous reduction in sales and pressure from conservative investors, institutions and hedge funds decided to exit their shares. <strong>Within two weeks, 11 institutions and hedge funds exited their shares completely according to AB InBev’s 13F filings on June 30th, 2023</strong>.

              On the other hand, the second most popular beer company Molson Coors became the direct beneficiary. On major social media, the Bud Light boycotting masses called for the public to choose Coors Lite and Miller Light as alternatives to Bud Light, <strong>which led Molson Coors 50% increase in sales and over 10% increase in stock price $TAP </strong>.

              <li>
                On May 4th, Anheuser-Busch's CEO Michel Doukeris first time publicly disavowed the controversial partnership with Dylan Mulvaney on an earnings call with investors, stating that it was not intended as a marketing campaign. He shifted blame onto an outside advertising agency for approving the partnership without management's awareness. <strong> This announcement came on the heels of another substantial dip in sales, further exacerbating the company's troubles </strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                On May 10th, the global financial institution HSBC downgraded its rating of $BUD from 'Buy' to 'Hold,' reflecting concerns stemming from the ongoing boycott. <strong> Analyst Carlos Laboy downgraded the beverage stock to hold, saying there are “deeper problems than ABI admits.” </strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                On May 17th, Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Marsha Blackburn initiated a Senate investigation into Anheuser-Busch's partnership with Dylan Mulvaney. They cited specific concerns, such as Mulvaney's use of the word "girlhood" in her TikTok series' title, her self-identification as a girl, and worries regarding whether the partnership was aimed at marketing alcoholic beverages to children. This development added to the mounting pressure on the company.
              </li>
              <li>On May 19th, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation revoked Anheuser-Busch's top rating for LGBTQ+ equality, citing the company's failure to support Dylan Mulvaney during the boycott. <strong>The move marks a significant setback for the company's image and standing in the LGBTQ+ inclusion space.</strong></li>
              <li>By the end of May, Bud Light lost its long-held status as <strong>the top-selling beer in the United States, a position it had maintained for two decades</strong>. Modelo Especial emerged as the new top-selling beer during this period of upheaval.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
           During this third drop period, the key opinion leaders group added Rogan O’Handley with <strong>2.4 million followers on Instagram</strong> and Benny Johnson <strong>with 1.4 million followers on Twitter</strong>, who are both conservative commentators. And each one posted over 5 posts in the month related to the Boycott of Bud Light with over 265,000 and 77,000 interactions on average respectively.

            <h3>Stage 2: Summary of Three Drops</h2>
            <p>To conclude these three drops, we can see that they demonstrate a compelling picture of the substantial impact of social media and public sentiment on financial markets. The severe decline in stock price, the loss of Bud Light's long-held top-selling status, withdrawals from investors and the erosion of the company's reputation can be seen as the ongoing consequence of the trendy boycott of Bud Light on major social media.

              >Information Tracer - Interaction network</span
            >
            </div>
<p>Moreover, from the beginning of the boycott till now, as a testament to the impact of the boycott, phrases like "Bud Lighted," "Bud Lighting," and "Go woke, go broke" have been circulating on the Internet. The phrases describe a boycott strategy designed to challenge so-called "rainbow capitalism," branding corporations as "awakeners" and calling for a boycott of issues ranging from Adidas' gender-inclusive swimsuits to The North Face's marketing campaign featuring drag queen and environmentalist Pattie Gonia.
</p>
            <h3>Stage 3: Tips for similar Insidents in the Future</h3>
            <p>
Following the methodology used to analyze the Boycott of Bud Light, there is a possibility to detect similar incidents in the future.</p>
<p>By using social media collector tools like informative tracer, we are able to quickly locate the key opinion leaders and related hashtags at the beginning of the event . <strong>Since key opinion leaders and hashtags are less likely to change throughout the entire incident, we can collect them as soon as possible and analyze the feed sentiments from them, which would largely determine the potential trends related to the stock price</strong>. </p>     
 <p>Even though there may be a lot of fake news, there is a rule of thumbs, <strong>“Buy on rumors, sell on news,”</strong> so if we can tell the consistent sentiments from key opinion leaders or hashtags like Bud Light Boycott, then there is a way to go. However, it is necessary to follow other factors like market performance, industry trends, company earnings and company changes while we keep tracking the updates from key opinion leaders and hashtags. Eventually, we will have a much higher probability to make a great profit based on the information we have.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              As we conclude our exploration of the intriguing correlation between social media posts and stock price changes, it becomes abundantly clear that the impact of the online world on financial markets is profound and undeniable. Our journey through the realms of behavioral economics, influential figures in the social media landscape, real-world case studies, and the intricacies of causation versus correlation has shed light on the complex dynamics at play. By using the similar analytics techniques on social media, we can possibly ride on the trends with great profits.
